alert.imdbsearch.limits=Due to limits of the service contract with IMDB, there is a maximum number of IMDB service calls that can be made per day. \
					If that limit is reached, you will not be able to use the IMDB Search service again until the next day.  Note that each page of results \
					viewed for a search counts as another hit on the IMDB service, as does each action of adding a movie to a collection. \
					Despite these limits, feel free to use this service as much needed.
